      //1 The first bug i found was in the first loop function.
      // i found the bug using the console. It said it can't add-up arr1
      // i looked at getSum and saw that the isn't a comma between arr1 and arr2.
      // the next problem I found was using the dev tools ion chrome, about a const variable.
      // I saw that the sum variable is const when it should be let in order to be updated in the loop
